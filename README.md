## Modelling Uncertainty in Deep Learning

This is an re-implementation of Yarin Gal's [interactive demo](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html) 


My presentation slide is available inside the doc folder.

### Usage

```{python}
python main.py
```

will play an animation that depicts the uncertainty estimate of Dropout NN.
